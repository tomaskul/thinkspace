### Acquiring the project
As one of the year-long 2<sup>nd</sup> year Computer Science modules, I had to work on a specific project with group of my peers. The fist stage of acquiring the project included writing an experessions of interest towards 3 of our groups' preffered projects, and doing a small presentations pitching ourselves to the project supervisors. We successfully received offer to work on our 1st choice project which involved developing and implementing an inverse reinforced learning algorithm (En.wikipedia.org, 2017) which given a demonstration of a driving style, would be able to learn and replicate the shown behaviour.

### Team
Our team was comprised of total of 6 people with good distribution of skills and experience all across the board (i.e., GUI experience, Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence students). And as we all understood that self driving vehicles are the future, and found the project involving development of AI which is capable of learning to drive itself quite exciting we were all driven and motivated to completing the project.

### My role
I volunteered to work on the GUI of the program, implementing the drawing functionality which allows displaying the simulated driving, screen navigation, CSS implementation, and connecting other aspects of the program within one application window.

### Final product
TBA

### Demo day
During this event, our group will demonstrate the finished application which we built over the course of the academic year, to wider audience, namely other students, university staff and companies which sponsored other projects. This will involve showcasing the program and walking people through the project. 

## Tools/Languages used in Development

- Java / JavaFX 8
- WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)(Cs.waikato.ac.nz, 2017)
