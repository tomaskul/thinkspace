### Acquiring the project
As one of the year-long 2<sup>nd</sup> year Computer Science modules, I had to work on a specific project with group of my peers. The first stage of acquiring the project included writing expressions of interest towards 3 of our groups' preferred projects, and doing a small presentation pitching ourselves to the project supervisors. We successfully received offer to work on our 1<sup>st</sup> choice project which involved developing and implementing an inverse reinforced learning algorithm (En.wikipedia.org, 2017) which given a demonstration of a driving style, would be able to learn and replicate the shown behaviour.

### Team
Our team was comprised of total of 6 people with good distribution of skills and experience across the board (i.e., GUI experience, Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence students). As we all understood that self-driving vehicles are the way of the future, and found the project involving development of AI which is capable of learning to drive itself quite exciting, which is not only motivated to pick this project, but to also be driven and motivated to completing the project.

At the start of the project we all agreed that in order to best utilise our skills and expertise we would split into 3 sub-groups: one to develop the artificial intelligence, one to develop the simulation, and one to develop the graphical user interface which is where my responsibilities resided.

### The Project
Here's an excerpt from the project brief, outlining the specification of the project

>Apprenticeship learning also known as learning by demonstration or imitation learning, is a machine learning approach for generalising the demonstrations provided by an expert. This project involves implementation of a Java based tool which contains a simulator for driving a car on a high way with multiple lanes and a chosen apprenticeship learning technique to learn how to drive safely avoiding collisions. The car under control will have a fixed speed higher than the other cars on the way. The left lane should be preferred over the middle lane over the right lane, over driving off-road. The goal is to generate an AUtomated DRIver (AUDRI) by learning to drive properly on the highway mimicking the behaviour of a demonstrator and if possible, even improving the learning process by using the data obtained from some previous demonstrators. The tool should also allow a user to evaluate/observe his/her safe driving skills as compared to AUDRI on the same simulation interface.

### My role
I volunteered to work on the GUI of the program, implementing the drawing functionality which allows displaying the simulated driving, screen navigation, CSS implementation, and connecting other aspects of the program within one application window.

### Demo day
During this event, our group will demonstrate the finished application which we built over the course of the academic year, to wider audience, namely other students, university staff and companies which sponsored other projects. This will involve showcasing the program and walking people through the project. 

To be completed
