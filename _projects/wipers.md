This project was a college assignment where I was tasked with going through all of the key steps of software development (design, plan, 
implementation & testing) and creating an educational video game based on a a particular event of WW1.

I chose 2<sup>nd</sup> battle of Ypres. Wipers (The English speaking soldier prenounciation of the town's name) is a top down shooter 
which aims to educate players about the events that took place during this specific battle (i.e., first mass use by Germany of poison gas 
on the Western Front <sup>(En.wikipedia.org, 2017)</sup> ).

## Tools/Languages used in Development

- GML
- Adobe Photoshop CS6
