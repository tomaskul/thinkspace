content: I'm Tomas Kulvietis, and I am BSc Computer Science student at the University of Nottingham. Currently I am on a placement year as a Software Developer. This site is primarily intended to showcase projects I have worked on, and secondly allow me to share/document dev/tech related stuff. (PS. The views I express here (whole blog) are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer)
