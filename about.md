My name is Tomas Kulvietis, I am 3<sup>rd</sup> year BSc Computer Science student at The University of Nottingham, and I am currently on my year-long placement, developing software. I enjoy programming and design (check out some of previous projects [here](/projects/)). This website will serve as my blog/portfolio of things I have worked on, I am working on, and believe worth sharing in general!
