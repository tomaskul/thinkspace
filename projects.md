This page contains links to all of the projects I have worked on / I'm currently working on and thought were worthy of sharing.

### 2017

- [AUDRI- An Automated Driver](https://tomaskul.github.io/projects/audri/)

  > Once the project had concluded, our team had produced a program which met all the specified requirements, followed good code practices, had simple and easy to follow user interface, ran without any problems.

- [C++ Game Prototype](https://tomaskul.github.io/projects/cpp-game/)

  > I met most of the requirements getting 60% of the marks. Although the prototype has been pretty terrible, it did help me solidify my C++ understanding, learn about SDL2, and allow me to implement things such as vector based object container, class hierarchies and object factories

- [Image Processing Script](https://tomaskul.github.io/projects/image-processing-script/)

  > I was assigned to create a simple image processing script which implements some of the core image processing principles in order to generate a binary image from a small set of pictures of plants.
